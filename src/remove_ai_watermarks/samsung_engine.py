"""Samsung Galaxy AI visible watermark detector/localizer.

Samsung's on-device Generative AI photo edits burn a visible "✦ Contenuti generati
dall'AI" wordmark into the bottom-LEFT corner (the Italian locale variant calibrated
here; the string is locale-specific -- DETECTION only matches this locale's silhouette,
so other locales are not yet detected, though the fill mask itself is locale-agnostic).
It is a faint, near-white semi-transparent overlay, the same overlay class as the
Doubao/Jimeng marks but bottom-left.

Detection matches the bundled glyph silhouette against the corner; removal is the
shared **localize -> fill** (a detector-aligned alpha :meth:`footprint_mask` feeds
``region_eraser``), NOT reverse-alpha. This module shares
:class:`remove_ai_watermarks._text_mark_engine.TextMarkEngine` and
supplies only Samsung's tuned :class:`TextMarkConfig` (bottom-LEFT corner, a lower glyph
luma since the mark is faint, ``assets/samsung_alpha.png`` -- the detection silhouette,
solved from the flat captures by ``scripts/visible_alpha_solve.py``). Samsung Galaxy AI
edits are also caught by C2PA + the ``genAIType`` marker, so this is the visible-mark
*removal* path; it also feeds ``identify`` as the medium-confidence ``visible_samsung``
signal via the registry.
