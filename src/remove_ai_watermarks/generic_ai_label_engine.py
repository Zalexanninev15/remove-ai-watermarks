"""Generic bare "AI生成" text-mark detector/localizer (brand-less TC260 fallback).

Every other text-mark engine in this package is tuned to one vendor's exact wordmark
silhouette ("豆包AI生成" for Doubao, "★ 即梦AI" for Jimeng, and so on). This engine
instead catches a BARE "AI生成" (or "AI generated") corner strip with **no brand
wordmark in front of it** -- the China GB 45438-2025 / TC260 explicit-AIGC label
stamped by OS- and gallery-level AI-edit tools that do not carry a distinct generator
brand of their own, as opposed to a named generator product like Doubao or Kling.

Research evidence (2026-09-21, see the library's task history; no dedicated brand
wordmark exists to tune a config against, so this is deliberately the generic
catch-all rather than one more brand-pinned engine):

  * vivo's own support documentation confirms its Gallery app stamps a bare "AI生成"
    watermark after AI消除 (AI object removal) / AI扩图 (AI expand) / 大片模式 (AI
    scene effects) editing, user-togglable under Album Settings -> "AI编辑后显示AI
    标识" ("Show AI label after AI edit") -- https://www.vivo.com.cn/service/questions/all?categoryId=170&questionId=2104
  * Independent reporting (今日头条 2026) documents the same bare "AI生成" watermark
    on Xiaomi's Gallery AI-edit output, with users asking how to remove it.
  * Community reporting suggests Samsung's China-locale Galaxy AI gallery tools stamp
    "AI生成" too, distinct from the Italian "Contenuti generati dall'AI" string this
    library's ``samsung`` engine already targets (different locale render of the same
    product, not covered here).
  * OPPO/Huawei almost certainly ship an equivalent compliance stamp under the same
    mandate, but no independent confirmation of the exact wording was found.

The label is compliance-driven, not brand-driven, so it is PLAUSIBLE that several
manufacturers' gallery apps render the exact same "AI生成" string with only styling
differences (font, position, background pill) -- which is exactly why this is one
generic fallback keyed on the bare text, not a family of near-duplicate per-OEM
configs.

Detection reuses the shared physical assumption every other text mark in this family
already encodes (``MAX_SATURATION`` / ``LOGO_MIN_LUMA`` / ``TOPHAT_DELTA``): a light,
low-saturation glyph rendered brighter than its local background, mandated by GB
45438-2025's own "light-colored watermark" house style, not a vendor-specific
measurement. Everything else here is UNMEASURED and synthetic: there is no captured
vendor screenshot to solve an alpha map from (the standing ``visible_alpha_solve.py``
approach), because the mark has no logo element to capture -- only literal text, so
``scripts/render_vendor_silhouettes.py`` -- the shared capture-less font-rendering
pipeline already used for Qwen/Baidu/Kling/Yuanbao's own text-only marks -- renders
"AI生成" directly as the alpha-template asset (``assets/generic_ai_label_alpha.png``),
which plugs into the same :class:`TextMarkConfig` machinery every other mark uses.

CALIBRATION CAVEAT: ``DETECT_NCC_THRESHOLD`` below is fit on a SYNTHETIC corpus only
(the rendered glyph composited onto generated backgrounds at varied scale/opacity,
scored against generated clean negatives and the six existing brand marks' own
composited examples as a false-positive/rival check) -- see
``scripts/calibrate_generic_ai_label.py`` for the recall/precision table it produced.
At initial calibration, no real "AI生成"-generator screenshot was available. A
later retained-corpus review confirmed dark, boxed, and longer-text labels that
this template misses; they are not calibration positives for this silhouette.
Treat this detector as WEAKER evidence than the brand-tuned engines until it is
recalibrated on independently labeled real captures; the ``rivals`` margin below exists
specifically so a genuine Doubao/Jimeng/Qwen/Baidu/Kling/Yuanbao mark -- every one of
which literally contains the substring "AI生成" in its own glyphs -- is attributed to
its own tuned engine instead of double-firing here.
