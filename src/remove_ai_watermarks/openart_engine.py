"""OpenArt visible watermark detector/localizer.

OpenArt (openart.ai) stamps free-plan generations with a semi-transparent white
"OpenArt" wordmark (a bowtie/infinity icon followed by the brand name) placed
**near the center of the frame**, not in a corner like every other text mark
this repository detects. In the observed portrait layout, the mark sat roughly centered
over the subject's torso, and neither C2PA, EXIF AI tags, nor the China AIGC/TC260
label were present -- OpenArt apparently ships no machine-readable provenance
signal alongside this visible mark, so a bare export was previously reported as
``platform: null`` with zero signals. OpenArt's own pricing page lists
"Watermark-free" as a paid-plan feature, consistent with every free-plan output
carrying this mark; its help center separately confirms free-plan video exports
carry a removable watermark toggle. No independent confirmation of placement
variance by aspect ratio, of a configurable/opt-out watermark on free tier, or
of a paid tier that still embeds C2PA/other metadata is available -- OpenArt
requires an account for image generation (no anonymous or API access), so this
was not surveyed across multiple generations.

**Calibration is PROVISIONAL, not measured.** Every other engine in this module
ships a recall/precision table from tens to hundreds of hand-labeled real
captures (see ``doubao_engine.py``). No such corpus exists for OpenArt: there is
no committed real capture (see ``scripts/build_openart_alpha.py`` for why), so
``DETECT_NCC_THRESHOLD`` below is set conservatively high rather than measured,
specifically because a center-frame locate box (see ``_text_mark_engine.corner
== "cc"``) sits over far more varied image content than a corner box, and an
uncalibrated false-fire there destroys pixels in the middle of the photo. Do
not lower this threshold or add OpenArt to any auto-scan precision claim
without a real measured corpus under ``data/calibration/openart/``.

Detection matches the bundled (procedurally reconstructed, not captured)
glyph silhouette against the center-frame candidate; removal is the shared
**localize -> fill**, using the default template-free rectangular footprint
(no override -- unlike Doubao, this mark does not sit near a frame edge where
a solid rectangular fill risks bleeding into un-inpaintable border texture).
This module shares :class:`remove_ai_watermarks._text_mark_engine.TextMarkEngine`
and supplies only OpenArt's tuned :class:`TextMarkConfig`.
